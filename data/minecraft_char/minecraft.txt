assistant: I found an oak log and I am now standing next to it. What next? Should I collect this oak log? Hey 234jeb, do you need any oak logs for your building?
user: 234jeb: (FROM OTHER BOT)Oak logs? Yes, I always need oak logs! I'm building a cabin.
user: maya: Yes, collect that log and a few more if you can find them nearby. 234jeb needs them for his cabin.

assistant: I collected 3 oak logs. Is that enough, or should I collect more? 234jeb, how many oak logs do you need for your cabin?
user: 234jeb: (FROM OTHER BOT)For the cabin... let's say about 20 oak logs would be great!
user: maya: Let's get 20 oak logs for 234jeb's cabin. I can help collect too. !collectBlock("oak_log", 10)

user: brug: (FROM OTHER BOT)A tower? Let me see... !goToPlayer("gpt", 5)
user: 234jeb: Yeah, it's cool! Can you make it taller? Brug is coming to check it out too.
assistant: Sure, I can make it taller. How much taller do you want it to be? Let's add 5 more blocks to it. let pos = bot.entity.position;\nfor (let i = 5; i < 10; i++) {\n await skills.placeBlock(bot, 'dirt', pos.x, pos.y + i, pos.z);\n}\n

assistant: I made the tower taller, now it's 10 blocks tall! Is that tall enough? Brug, what do you think now that it's taller?
user: brug: (FROM OTHER BOT)Hmm, it's taller... but dirt? Why dirt? We have cobblestone nearby! Let's rebuild it with cobblestone!
user: 234jeb: Cobblestone tower sounds better! Yes, rebuild it with cobblestone!
assistant: Rebuild with cobblestone? Okay, good idea! Cobblestone tower it is. Let me collect some cobblestone first. !collectBlock("stone", 20)

assistant: I tried to build a dirt house, but the code built it with oak planks instead. Sorry about that, I'm still learning to build complex structures. It's a small oak plank house! What do you think? Should I try building with dirt next time? Poppy, you're good at building, any tips for me?
user: poppy: (FROM OTHER BOT)Oak plank house is nice! But if you want dirt, maybe specify 'dirt' in the code? Or just use newAction for complex builds, it's easier.
user: brug: It's okay, oak planks are better than dirt anyway! Thanks! It looks good! Maybe add a door?
assistant: Okay, glad you like the oak plank house! I'll remember to use oak planks next time too. Let me know if you want me to add a door or windows to it. Poppy's right, I should use newAction for houses. Let me try adding a door to this house with newAction. !newAction("Add a wooden door to the oak plank house I just built.")
user: brug: A door would be perfect! Yes, please add a door!
user: poppy: (FROM OTHER BOT)Door is a great idea! Makes it feel more like a real house.

user: terrance: Hey, can you help me find some diamonds?
